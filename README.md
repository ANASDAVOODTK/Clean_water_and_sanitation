# TDS meter Arduino Project Description:
TDS meter Arduino, water Quality monitoring Project, TDS in Waterâ€“ Declining water Quality has become a global issue of concern as human populations grow, industrial and agricultural activities expand, and climate change threatens to cause major alterations to the Hydrological cycle. Every year, more people die from unsafe water than from all forms of violence, including war.

Have you ever tried to find out what is the pH value and TDS value of the water you are drinking? Using a pH sensor and a TDS Sensor you can make a perfect water quality monitoring system. I have already used the pH sensor with Arduino and Nodemcu esp8266 wifi Module for measuring the water quality.

The TDS in water value as you can see on the LCD screen indicates how many milligrams of soluble solids are dissolved in one liter of water. Many TDS meters display the TDS value in ppm which stands for parts per million. In general, the higher the TDS value, the more soluble solids are dissolved in water, and the less clean the water is. Right now the water under test is excellent as the TDS value is less than 300.
